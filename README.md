Correlation coefficients measure linear relationship strength (-1 to +1). Negative values indicate inverse, positive values indicate direct associations, and 0 implies no linear link. Common coefficients—Pearson, Spearman, and Kendall's tau—suit different data relationships. Understanding these is crucial for effective data analysis.
